EDITING
-------
The screen is divided into 'logical lines' whose length can exceed the width
of the physical line. The logical line includes all the text on the line. If 
the line has been wrapped or broken by <CTRL+J>, the logical line extends 
into the next physical line. 
The following keys have a special effect:
<UP> or <CTRL+6>            Move the cursor up, except at line 1.
<DOWN> or <CTRL+->          Move the cursor down, except at line 24. Line 25
                            cannot be reached with the arrow keys. 
<LEFT> or <CTRL+]>          Move the cursor left. The left edge of the screen 
                            wraps around, except at line 1.
<RIGHT> or <CTRL+/>         Move the cursor right. The right edge of the 
                            screen wraps around, except at line 24.
<CTRL+LEFT> or <CTRL+B>     Move to the first letter of the previous word. A 
                            word consists of letters A-Z and figures 0-9.
<CTRL+RIGHT> or <CTRL+F>    Move to the first letter of the next word.
<TAB> or <CTRL+I>           Move the cursor to the next tab stop. Tab stops
                            are 8 columns wide.
<BACKSPACE> or <CTRL+H>     Delete the character left of the cursor, shift 
                            all further characters on the logical line one 
                            position to the left and change the attributes of 
                            those characters to the current attribute. At the 
                            left edge of the screen, this does the same as 
                            <DEL>.
<DEL> or <CTRL+BACKSPACE>   Delete the character at the cursor and shift all 
                            further characters one position to the left, 
                            changing attributes to current.
<ESC> or <CTRL+[>           Delete the current logical line
<CTRL+END> or <CTRL+E>      Delete all characters from the cursor to the end 
                            of the logical line.
<CTRL+BREAK> or <CTRL+C>    Jump to the first column of the next line, 
or <CTRL+SCROLL_LOCK>       without executing or storing the line under the 
                            cursor.
<ENTER> or <CTRL+M>         Execute or store the current screen line. The 
                            complete line on the screen is considered part of 
                            the command, including any text you did not type. 
                            A line starting with a number is stored as a 
                            program line.
<END> or <CTRL+N>           Move the cursor to the first position after the 
                            end of the logical line.
<HOME> or <CTRL+K>          Move the cursor to the top left of the screen.
<CTRL+HOME> or <CTRL+L>     clear the screen and move the cursor to the top 
                            left of the screen.
<CTRL+ENTER> or <CTRL+J>    Move to the first column of the next line, 
                            connecting the two lines into one logical line.
<CTRL+G>                    Beep.
<PAUSE> or <CTRL+NUM_LOCK>  Pause. Press another key to resume.
<CTRL+PRT_SC>               Echo screen output to the printer.
<SHIFT+PRT_SC>              Print the screen.
<INS> or <CTRL+R>           Toggle INSERT mode. In INSERT mode, characters  
                            are inserted rather than overwritten at the 
                            current location. If insertion causes the line to 
                            extend the physical screen width, the logical 
                            line extends onto the next line. Arrow keys exit 
                            INSERT mode.

ABS(x) function
---------------
Returns the absolute value of 'x'. 'x' is an expression with a numeric value.
If 'x' has a string value, ABS raises TYPE MISMATCH.


ASC(x) function
---------------
Returns the ASCII code for the first character of x. x is an expression with 
a string value.
If 'x' has a numeric value, ASC raises TYPE MISMATCH.
If 'x' equals "", ASC raises ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL.


ATN(x) function
---------------
Returns the inverse tangent of x. x is an expression with a numeric value in 
radians. Unless BASIC is run with the --double option, ATN(x) returns a 
single-precision value.
If x has a string value, ABS raises TYPE MISMATCH.


AUTO statement
AUTO [line_number | .] [, [increment]] 
--------------
Enter automatic line numbering mode (AUTO mode). In AUTO mode, line numbers 
are automatically generated when <ENTER> is pressed.
Line numbering starts at 'line_number', if specified. If . is specified, line 
numbering starts at the last program line that was stored. Otherwise, line
numbering starts at 10. 
Each next line number is incremented by 'increment', if specified. If a comma 
is used withoud specifying an increment, the last increment specified in an 
AUTO command is used. If not, increment defaults to 10.
If a program line exists at a generated line number, a '*' is shown after the 
line number. To avoid overwriting this line, leave it empty and press <ENTER>.
To exit AUTO mode, press <CTRL+BREAK> or <CTRL+C>. The line being edited at 
that point is not saved. BASIC will return to command mode, even if AUTO was 
run from a program line.
If line_number is not an unsigned-integer value between 0 and 65529, 
inclusive, SYNTAX ERROR is raised.
In AUTO mode, pressing <ENTER> on an empty line with number larger than 
65519, UNDEFINED LINE NUMBER is raised.


BEEP statement
BEEP
--------------
Beeps at 800Hz for 0.25s.


BLOAD statement
BLOAD filename [, offset]
---------------
Raises ADVANCED FEATURE.
In GW-BASIC, BLOAD loads an image file into memory. 
This is not implemented in PC-BASIC 3.23.   


BSAVE statement
BSAVE filename, offset, length
---------------
Raises ADVANCED FEATURE.
In GW-BASIC, BSAVE saves a region of memory to an image file. 
This is not implemented in PC-BASIC 3.23.  


CALL statement
CALL address, variables
--------------
Raises ADVANCED FEATURE.
In GW-BASIC, CALL executes a machine language subroutine.
This is not implemented in PC-BASIC 3.23.  


CDBL(x) function
----------------
Converts the numeric-valued expression 'x' to a double-precision value.
If 'x' has a string value, TYPE MISMATCH is raised.


CHAIN statement
CHAIN [MERGE] program [, [line_number] [, [ALL] [, DELETE range]]]
---------------
Loads 'program' into memory and runs it, optionally transferring variables.
If 'line_number' is specified, it must be a numeric-valued expression. It 
will be interpreted as a line number is the new program. If 'line_number' is
negative, it will be interpreted as its two's-complement. 
If ALL is specified, all variables are transferred. If not, the variables 
specified in a COMMON statement are transferred. 
IF MERGE is specified, 'program' is merged into the existing program. To be 
able to use this, 'program' must be saved as ASCII.
If DELETE is specified, the 'range' of line numbers is deleted from the 
existing code before the merge. This is pointless without MERGE.


CHDIR statement
CHDIR pathname
---------------
Change the working directory to 'pathname'. 'pathname' is a string-valued 
expression which can be absolute or relative to the current path. 'pathname'
must be specified with MS-DOS path separators (\). CHDIR first looks for the
exact, case-sensitive (on Unix) path 'pathname'; if this does not exist then
an uppercase version truncated to 8.3 is attempted.
If no matching path is found, PATH NOT FOUND is raised.
If 'pathname' is not string-valued, TYPE MISMATCH is raised.
If 'pathname' is empty, BAD FILE NAME is raised.


CHR$(x) function
----------------
Returns the character with ASCII code 'x'. 'x' must have a numeric value 
between 0 and 255 (inclusive). 
If 'x' is a string value, TYPE MISMATCH is raised.
If 'x' is not 0<=x<=255, ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL is raised.
If 'x' is too large to fit a two-byte signed integer, OVERFLOW is raised.
