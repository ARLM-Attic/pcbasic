<h2 id="settings">Changing settings</h2>
<p>PC-BASIC has a number of settings that change the way it operates. There are
two ways to change these settings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Command-line options</dt>
<dd>You can enter command-line options if you start PC-BASIC from the console (the <em>Command Prompt</em> or <em>PowerShell</em> in Windows, or a <em>Terminal</em> in Unix), by preceding the name of the option with two dashes, like so:<br/>
<pre>pcbasic --preset=tandy --ctrl-c-break=True
</pre>
On the command line, you can leave out the expression <code>=True</code> that is common in switching options.
Some options have an alternative, short name consisting of a single letter preceded by a single dash, which you can use on the command line. You can combine multiple short options with a single dash.</dd>
<dt>Configuration files</dt>
<dd>You can change options by adding or removing lines in your private configuration file.
This configuration file is a file named <code>PCBASIC.INI</code> stored in your
Application Data folder. The location of this folder is as follows:
<dl class="compact">
<dt>Windows</dt><dd><code>%AppData%\pcbasic</code></dd>
<dt>OS X</dt><dd><code>~/Library/Application Support/pcbasic</code></dd>
<dt>Linux</dt><dd><code>~/.config/pcbasic</code></dd>
</dl>
Change an option in the configuration file by adding a line in the section named <code>[pcbasic]</code>, like so:
<pre>preset=tandy
ctrl-c-break=True
</pre>
You cannot use the sort name of options in the configuration file. You also cannot leave out the expression <code>=True</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In either method, the options have the same name and syntax. In what follows, we will often refer to
a particular option setting; remember that you can always set this from the command line as well as from the configuration file.</p>
