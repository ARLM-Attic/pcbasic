<h1 id="settings">Settings and options</h1>
<p>
    PC-BASIC has a number of settings that change the way it operates. There are
    two ways to change these settings:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Command-line options</dt>
    <dd>
        You can enter command-line options if you start PC-BASIC from the console
        (also known as the <em>Command Prompt</em> or <em>Terminal</em>;
        this is normally <code>CMD</code> or <code>PowerShell</code> on Windows),
        by preceding the name of the option
        with two dashes, like so:
        <code class="block"><b>pcbasic <a href="#--preset">--preset</a>=tandy <a href="#--ctrl-c-break">--ctrl-c-break</a>=True</b></code>
        On the command line, you can leave out the expression <code><b>=True</b></code>
        that is common in switching options.
        Some options have an alternative, short name consisting of a single
        letter preceded by a single dash, which you can use on the command line.
        You can combine multiple short options with a single dash.
    </dd>
    <dt>Configuration files</dt>
    <dd>
        You can change options by adding or removing lines in your private configuration file.
        This configuration file is a file named <code>PCBASIC.INI</code> stored in your
        Application Data folder. The location of this folder is as follows:
        <dl class="compact">
            <dt>Windows</dt><dd><code>%AppData%\pcbasic</code></dd>
            <dt>OS X</dt><dd><code>~/Library/Application Support/pcbasic</code></dd>
            <dt>Linux</dt><dd><code>~/.config/pcbasic</code></dd>
        </dl>
        Change an option in the configuration file by adding a line in the section named <code>[pcbasic]</code>, like so:
        <code class="block">
            [pcbasic]<br/>
            <a href="#--preset">preset</a>=tandy<br/>
            <a href="#--ctrl-c-break">ctrl-c-break</a>=True
        </code>
        You cannot use the sort name of options in the configuration file.
        You also cannot leave out the expression <code><b>=True</b></code>.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>
    In either method, the options have the same name and syntax. In what follows, we will often refer to
    a particular option setting; remember that you can always set this from the command line as well as from the configuration file.
