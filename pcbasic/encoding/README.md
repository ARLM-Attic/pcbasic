PC-BASIC codepages
------------------

Numbered code pages refer to the OEM code pages as defined by Microsoft.
Where there is a numbering conflict or unclarity, names are used instead of
numbers. Numbered code pages agree with Microsoft sources in the ranges 80-FF,
where those sources are available.
Code point 00 is always treated as NUL and shown as empty space.
The printable ASCII points 20-7E always map to the corresponding ASCII characters.
If the code page reassigns any of the printable ASCII, the reassigned glyph is
used but the character continues to be treated as its ASCII original.
Most code pages use the Special Graphic Characters range at 01-1F and 7F; the
mapping is at http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MISC/IBMGRAPH.TXT  

See the PC-BASIC documentation for a list of supported codepages and
their names, which agree with the file names in this directory.
