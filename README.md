### PC-BASIC ###
_A free, cross-platform emulator for the GW-BASIC family of interpreters._

PC-BASIC is a free, cross-platform interpreter for GW-BASIC, Advanced BASIC (BASICA), PCjr Cartridge Basic and Tandy 1000 GW-BASIC.
It interprets these BASIC dialects with a high degree of accuracy, aiming for bug-for-bug compatibility.
PC-BASIC emulates the most common video and audio hardware on which these BASICs used to run.
PC-BASIC runs ASCII, bytecode and protected .BAS files.
It implements floating-point arithmetic in the Microsoft Binary Format (MBF) and can therefore
read and write binary data files created by GW-BASIC.  

PC-BASIC is free and open source software released under the GPL version 3.

### Quick Start Guide ###

This quick start guide covers installation and elementary use of PC-BASIC. For more information, please refer to the [full PC-BASIC documentation](http://pc-basic.org/doc/) which covers usage, command-line options and a full GW-BASIC language reference. This documentation is also included with the current PC-BASIC release.

If you find bugs, please report them on the [SourceForge discussion page](https://sourceforge.net/p/pcbasic/discussion/bugs/). It would be most helpful if you could include a short bit of BASIC code that triggers the bug.


#### Installation ####
Packaged distributions are currently available for Windows XP and above and Mac OSX 10.6 and above. For Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora Linux an install script is provided in the source distribution.

They can be downloaded from one of the following locations:  

- [PC-BASIC releases on GitHub](https://github.com/robhagemans/pcbasic/releases)  
- [PC-BASIC releases on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcbasic/files/)  

On **Windows**:  

- run the installer  
- to start, click PC-BASIC in your Start menu  

On **OS X**:  

- mount the disk image  
- move `PC-BASIC.app` to your Applications folder  
- to start, double click the PC-BASIC app  

On **Linux**:  

- untar the archive  
- run `sudo ./install.sh`  
- to start, click PC-BASIC in your Applications menu or run `pcbasic` on the command line.  

If the options above are not applicable or you prefer to install from source, please
consult `SOURCE.md` for instructions.

#### Usage essentials ####
Double-click on `pcbasic` or run `pcbasic` on the command line to start in interactive mode with no programs.  
A few selected command-line options:  
`pcbasic PROGRAM.BAS` runs PROGRAM.BAS directly.  
`pcbasic -h` shows all available command line options.  

If you're running PC-BASIC from a GUI, you can set the required options in the configuration file instead. The configuration file is a file named `PCBASIC.INI`, stored in the following location:

| OS         | Configuration file location  
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
| Windows XP | `C:\Documents and Settings\` (your username) `\Application Data\pcbasic`  
| Windows 7  | `C:\Users\` (your username) `\AppData\Roaming\pcbasic`  
| OS X       | `~/Library/Application Support/pcbasic`
| Linux      | `~/.config/pcbasic`  

For example, you could include the following line in `PCBASIC.INI` to emulate IBM PCjr Cartridge Basic instead of GW-BASIC 3.23:

    preset=pcjr  


For a full list of options, run `pcbasic -h` or consult the
[PC-BASIC usage documentation](http://pc-basic.org/doc#settings)
included with PC-BASIC and available online.


#### Basic BASIC commands ####
PC-BASIC starts in interactive mode, where you can execute BASIC statements directly.
A few essential statements:  
`SYSTEM` exits PC-BASIC.  
`LOAD "PROGRAM"` loads `PROGRAM.BAS` but does not start it.  
`RUN` starts the currently loaded program.  
`RUN "PROGRAM"` loads and starts `PROGRAM.BAS`.  

For more information, please consult the comprehensive
[PC-BASIC language reference](http://pc-basic.org/doc#reference)
included with PC-BASIC and available online.
