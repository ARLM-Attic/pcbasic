    # BASIC locks:
    #   '':   (SHARED): allow shared locks by others.
    #   'W':  (LOCK WRITE): deny write access to others, allow read
    #   'R':  (LOCK READ): deny read access to others, alow write
    #   'RW': (LOCK READ WRITE): deny both read and write locks to others.
    #   Default is RW, so you can't open a default mode on a file that is SHARED.
    # Unix locks:
    #   LOCK_SH: shared lock: allow other shared but not exclusive locks - others can read but not write.    
    #   LOCK_EX: exclusive lock: don't allow other locks; others can neither read nor write.
    # You cannot obtain an exclusive lock on a file open for reading:
    #   https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-bugs-list/2001-November/008378.html
    # It also appears you cannot obtain a shared lock on a file open for reading.
    # Is seems a perfect mapping is not possible - Unix has no 'deny read but not write' lock.
#    # Mapping used here:
#    #   SHARED -> LOCK_SH; LOCK WRITE -> LOCK_SH; LOCK READ -> LOCK_EX; LOCK READ WRITE -> LOCK_EX
#    if 'R' in lock and not 'r' in fhandle.mode:  # that's posix access mode
